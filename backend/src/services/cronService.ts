All of life‚Äôs questions find their answers in His Word.\n\nSome of you have been on this ride multiple times, while for most of you, it‚Äôs your first time. So, here are a few words of wisdom before you begin your journey to the heart of God:\n- Set aside 15 minutes a day and commit to reading during that time. Mornings right after waking up or evenings before bed tend to work best.\n- First-timers, focus on the big picture and how the stories connect. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt understand certain verses or topics. Make a note of them, you‚Äôll often find the answers in upcoming chapters or books.\n- If you fall behind, don‚Äôt stress. Skip what you missed and stay with the current day‚Äôs reading. You can catch up on the weekend when you have time. The most important thing is not to stop or give up, keep going!\n- You also have the option to listen instead of read, which can help you catch up quickly.\n- The goal is to finish reading the Scriptures one day at a time‚Äîjust 15 minutes a day.\n- You can also choose to read or listen in over 82 different languages.`
